# Tallon-AI-Probabilistic-Decision-Making-in-Mean-Arena
In this work, I designed an AI decision-making agent based on probabilistic reasoning and optimal policy planning, integrating Markov Decision Processes, value iteration, belief state updates and others to enable rational sequential decision-making under both fully observable and partially observable environments.
